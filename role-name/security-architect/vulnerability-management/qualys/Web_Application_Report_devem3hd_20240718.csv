WAS reports missing X-Content-Type-Options header on each crawled link for both static and dynamic responses. The scanner performs the check not only on 200 responses but 4xx and 5xx responses as well. It's also possible the QID will be reported on directory-level links.","All web browsers employ a content-sniffing algorithm that inspects the contents of HTTP responses and also occasionally overrides the MIME type provided by the server. If X-Content-Type-Options header is not present, browsers can potentially be tricked into treating non-HTML response as HTML. An attacker can then potentially leverage the functionality to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This specific case is known as a Content-Sniffing XSS (CS-XSS) attack.



","It is recommended to disable browser content sniffing by adding the X-Content-Type-Options header to the HTTP response with a value of 'nosniff'. Also, ensure that the 'Content-Type' header is set correctly on responses.

It is designed to allow the owners of domain names to find all certificates that have been issued for their domains, and which certificate authorities have issued them. This is done by requiring certificate authorities to publish all issued certificates in public logs. TLS servers can then provide cryptographic evidence to TLS clients that the server certificate has been registered in public logs, thus providing some degree of confidence that the certificate is legitimate. Such cryptographic evidence is referred to as an ""SCT Log Proof"".
<P>The information below lists all validated SCT Log Proofs for server certificates along with information about the public log, where available.

WAS checks for the missing CSP on all static and dynamic pages. It checks for CSP in the response headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Security-Policy or X-Webkit-CSP) and in response body (http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" meta tag).<P>

HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security it's important to set appropriate CSP policies on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.
","Content-Security Policy is a defense mechanism that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks in modern browsers. The CSP specification provides a set of content restrictions for web resources and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a server to a client where the policy is enforced. When a Content Security Policy is specified, a number of default behaviors in user agents are changed; specifically inline content and JavaScript eval constructs are not interpreted without additional directives. In short, CSP allows you to create a whitelist of sources of the trusted content. The CSP policy instructs the browser to only render resources from those whitelisted sources. Even though an attacker can find a security vulnerability in the application through which to inject script, the script won't match the whitelisted sources defined in the CSP policy, and therefore will not be executed.<P>

The absence of Content Security Policy in the response will allow the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities as the protection provided by the browser is not at all leveraged by the Web application. If secure CSP configuration is not implemented, browsers will not be able to block content-injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting and Clickjacking.

","Appropriate CSP policies help prevent content-injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It's recommended to add secure CSP policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach for securing web applications.<P>

","The X-XSS-Protection response header provides a layer of protection against reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by instructing browsers to abort rendering a page in which a reflected XSS attack has been detected. This is a best-effort second line of defense measure which helps prevent an attacker from using evasion techniques to avoid the neutralization mechanisms that the filters use by default. When configured appropriately, browser-level XSS filters can provide additional layers of defense against web application attacks.
<P>
Note that HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security the X-XSS-Protection header should be set on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.","It is recommend to set X-XSS-Protection header with value set to '1; mode=block' on all the relevant responses to activate browser's XSS filter.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> The X-XSS-Protection header is not supported by all browsers. Google Chrome and Safari are some of the browsers which support it, Firefox on the other hand does not support the header. X-XSS-Protection header does not guarantee a complete protection against XSS. For better protection against XSS attacks, the web application should use secure coding principles. Also, consider leveraging the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header, which is supported by all browsers.

<P>Using X-XSS-Protection could have unintended side effects, please understand the implications carefully before using it.

Note: If a cipher is included in this list it means that it was possible to establish a SSL connection using that cipher. There are some web servers setups that allow connections to be established using a LOW grade cipher, only to provide a web page stating that the URL is accessible only through a non-LOW grade cipher. In this case even though LOW grade cipher will be listed here QID 38140 will not be reported.

If no rate limiting or CAPTCHA is applied to form submissions, then vulnerability tests against this form may produce a significant amount of messages.

If so, consider excluding this form from being tested or disable the messaging during the web application scan.

Forms that generate messages can be abused by malicious users to create Denial of Service attacks. Apply rate limiting to the form in order to throttle the number of times it may be submitted by a user or by an IP address; or apply a CAPTCHA to it to reduce the chance of automated tools being used against the form.","10a01260-7c5f-4c4a-a46c-6f95c36a190b","","","","","","",""

WAS checks for the missing CSP on all static and dynamic pages. It checks for CSP in the response headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Security-Policy or X-Webkit-CSP) and in response body (http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" meta tag).<P>

HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security it's important to set appropriate CSP policies on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.
","Content-Security Policy is a defense mechanism that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks in modern browsers. The CSP specification provides a set of content restrictions for web resources and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a server to a client where the policy is enforced. When a Content Security Policy is specified, a number of default behaviors in user agents are changed; specifically inline content and JavaScript eval constructs are not interpreted without additional directives. In short, CSP allows you to create a whitelist of sources of the trusted content. The CSP policy instructs the browser to only render resources from those whitelisted sources. Even though an attacker can find a security vulnerability in the application through which to inject script, the script won't match the whitelisted sources defined in the CSP policy, and therefore will not be executed.<P>

The absence of Content Security Policy in the response will allow the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities as the protection provided by the browser is not at all leveraged by the Web application. If secure CSP configuration is not implemented, browsers will not be able to block content-injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting and Clickjacking.

","Appropriate CSP policies help prevent content-injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It's recommended to add secure CSP policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach for securing web applications.<P>
